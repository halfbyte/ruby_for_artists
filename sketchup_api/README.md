# The SketchUp examples

Unfortunately, Trimble, the (current) owner of SketchUp decided to retire the free standalone version for the latest release. Fortunately, the free Make version of the 2017 release is still available from their [All Downloads](https://www.sketchup.com/download/all) page, but I have no idea how long that will still be the case.

If you're on Mac, the rake task (rake install_hook) should work for you if you have SketchUp Make 2017 installed.

I wasn't able to find out quickly where Plugins go under Windows, so you'd need to adapth the path in the Rakefile for that.
