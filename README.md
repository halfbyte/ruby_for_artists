# Ruby For Artists

A weird and wonderful mixture of different ways to use ruby to make art

1. [Gosu](gosu/) - some simple examples of using gosu, the 2d game api
1. [JRubyArt](jruby_art/) - a simple example and partial port of the Sunburst tool, both taken from the book ["Generate Design"](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/)
1. [mittsu](mittsu/) a simple and a more complex example of Mittsu, the ThreeJS inspired OpenGL wrapper
1. [portmidi](portmidi/) some examples of using the portmidi library to use
1. [RubySynth](rubysynth/) an MVP of a ruby sound synthesizer system
1. [SketchUp API](sketchup_api/) two small examples on how to use Ruby to crate Geometry in SketchUP.
1. [the_talk](the_talk/) this is the actual presentation, using a quick template setup. It uses [Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark).

Other Projects mentioned in the talk:

- [halfbyte/calgen](/halfbyte/calgen) The prawn example I showed in the beginning
- [halfbyte/Gosu-Minesweeper](/halfbyte/Gosu-Minesweeper) The hack to make Minesweeper run on Launchpad (There's also my [version](https://github.com/halfbyte/padsweeper/) running in the Browser from JSUnconf2017, if you are a Minesweeper fan)
- [halfbyte/webovision](https://github.com/halfbyte/webovision) Not actually mentioned as this was the one thing I left out. ([See the result](https://pixelpoke.de/webovision/))
