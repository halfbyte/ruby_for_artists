# Caveat

Feck, I forgot to mention it during my talk: The current version of Mittsu is broken on current versions of MacOs and using the latest glfw version from Homebrew. This is known, I believe a fix is in the making. See [jellymann/mittsu#61](https://github.com/jellymann/mittsu/issues/61) for details.
